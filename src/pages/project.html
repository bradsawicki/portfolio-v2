      <p class="project--description">Cappello's is a gluten free, grain free gourmet food company located in Denver. In the fall of 2015, I completely updated the siteâ€™s interface and design, positioning their products directly on the homepage and providing users with easy access to important food information on the products pages. I leveraged the power of Shopify as the ecommerce platform. This gave Cappello's a whole slew of tools to streamline their online sales with their retail sales.</p>
