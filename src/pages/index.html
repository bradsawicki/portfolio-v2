      <h3 class="about--title">Brad SaWho?</h3>
      <p>The seeds of my computer-dependent career began with a few simple DOS commands and a minor obsession with King's Quest I thru V. Twenty years, a few college web courses and countless days/weeks/months spent behind the screen later, I now embrace my role as an interface designer.</p>
      <p>I've had the pleasure of contributing to the growth of a start-up from three guys in a basement to a dozen workers in a West Loop loft to forty employees in a corporate office. In October 2011, I set off on my own ceative journey, collaborating with friends, organizations, start-ups, and agencies all over the world.</p>
      <p>When I'm not getting off on great design and clean code I enjoy playing music, learning my wife’s mother tongue (Svenska), searching for the perfect burrito (Taco Burrito Express #3), hugging trees and floating down rivers.</p>
